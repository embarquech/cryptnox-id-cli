`cryptnox-id-cli` is a command-line interface for managing the **Cryptnox ID**
multi-applet smart card: **PIV** identity credentials, **FIDO2** passkeys, and
**MIFARE DESFire** contactless applications — three independent functions on
one physical card, driven by one tool.

---

## Supported hardware

### Cryptnox ID smart cards

One card, four applets, reachable over two interfaces:

| Function | Interface | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **PIV** (SP 800-73 keys + X.509 certificates) | Contact (admin), contact/contactless (use) | All personalization is contact-only |
| **FIDO2 / CTAP 2.1** (passkeys / WebAuthn) | Contactless (NFC) | Windows requires an Administrator terminal |
| **MIFARE DESFire** (incl. EV3 Secure Dynamic Messaging) | Contactless (NFC) | Needs a DESFire-capable reader |
| **Genuineness** (factory attestation) | Contact | Read-only; proves the card is genuine Cryptnox hardware |

### Smart card readers

Works with Cryptnox readers and any other standard PC/SC smart card reader:

| Reader | Type | Interface |
|--------|------|-----------|
| [Cryptnox® Smartcard Reader](https://shop.cryptnox.com/product/cryptnox-smartcard-reader/) | Contact (ID-1 + SIM) | USB-A |
| [Compact USB Mini Smartcard Reader](https://shop.cryptnox.com/product/mini-smartcard-reader/) | Contact (ID-1) | USB-A |
| [Cryptnox NFC Contactless Reader](https://shop.cryptnox.com/product/cryptnox-contactless-reader/) | Contactless (NFC/ISO 14443) | USB-C |

Verified third-party readers: ACS ACR39U (contact), ACS ACR1252 (contactless,
native DESFire OK). The HID OMNIKEY 5422CL does **not** support DESFire.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MIFARE DESFire requires a contactless reader that passes *native* DESFire
> commands — not all contactless readers do.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is only a minimal setup. Additional packages may be required depending
> on your operating system. See
> [Installation](https://docs.cryptnox.com/cryptnox-id-cli/installation.html)
> in the documentation.

Requirements: Python 3.10+ and a PC/SC stack (built into Windows and macOS; on
Linux install `pcscd` + `libccid`).

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install cryptnox-id-cli
```

Three interchangeable console commands are installed: `cryptnox-id`, the short
`cnx-id`, and `cryptnox-id-card`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryptnox/cryptnox-id-cli.git
cd cryptnox-id-cli
pip install .
```

## Quick usage examples

> [!TIP]
> The examples below are only a subset of available commands. The complete list
> of commands and detailed usage instructions is described in the
> [official documentation](https://docs.cryptnox.com/cryptnox-id-cli/).

### 1. Inspect the card

```bash
cryptnox-id readers     # list readers, card presence, ATR
cryptnox-id info        # detect the card + all functions on one screen
cryptnox-id doctor      # PC/SC service, reader, per-function reachability
```

`info` and `doctor` are read-only and safe to run any time.

### 2. Provision a PIV credential

1. Run `cryptnox-id piv quickstart` on a contact reader.
2. The card gets a key, a certificate, a CHUID and a CCC — usable by standard
   PIV tooling (`yubico-piv-tool`, OpenSC, OS smart-card stacks).

### 3. Create a passkey and prove the whole loop

1. Run `cryptnox-id fido credential self-test` — registers a credential,
   requests an assertion, and verifies the returned signature: the full
   WebAuthn round trip against the real authenticator.
2. For a resident, PIN-verified credential: `cryptnox-id fido pin set`, then
   re-run the self-test with `--rk`. On Windows, run from an Administrator
   terminal.

### 4. Prove the card is genuine

1. Run `cryptnox-id genuine verify` on a contact reader.
2. The card signs a fresh nonce and the on-card certificate is chained to the
   pinned Cryptnox root — the verdict is **GENUINE** only when both checks pass.

### 5. Work interactively

```bash
cryptnox-id shell       # run subcommands without re-typing the prefix
```

## Documentation

The full **User & Developer documentation** is available at the
[Cryptnox ID CLI Documentation](https://docs.cryptnox.com/cryptnox-id-cli/). It
covers installation and setup, quick starts and usage guides for every card
function (PIV, FIDO2, MIFARE DESFire, genuineness), the complete CLI command
reference, JSON output and exit codes, and factory/provisioning notes.

---

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check src tests && ruff format --check src tests
mypy
pytest -q -m "not real_card"
```

Unit tests use a mock transport — no reader or card required. Real-card tests
are opt-in (`-m real_card`) and never run in CI.
